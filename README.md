# django-blog

This is the back end of a blog created using Python and Django, based off of J. Mitchell's Coding For Entrepreneurs Django 1.9 tutorial. 

TODOs: 

1) Develop UX, so users can click from one page to another
2) Add header/navbar and footer, with links to my social media pages and my profile of coding projects
